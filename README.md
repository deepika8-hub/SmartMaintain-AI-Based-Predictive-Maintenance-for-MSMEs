 SmartMaintain – AI-Based Predictive Maintenance for MSMEs

---

1) Problem Statement

Unplanned equipment failures in MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) cause:

* Unexpected downtime
* High emergency repair costs
* Production delays
* Reduced equipment lifespan

Most MSMEs rely on reactive maintenance instead of predictive intelligence due to:

* High cost of industrial IoT systems
* Lack of data science expertise
* No affordable AI-based solution

**Objective:**
Build a low-cost, AI-driven predictive maintenance system that estimates machine failure probability and provides risk classification for proactive decision-making.

---

2) Proposed Solution

SmartMaintain is a lightweight web-based predictive maintenance system that:

* Accepts machine sensor data (CSV upload)
* Predicts failure probability using ML model
* Calculates health score
* Classifies risk level (Low / Medium / High)
* Estimates cost savings from preventive action

Designed specifically for MSMEs with minimal technical overhead.
